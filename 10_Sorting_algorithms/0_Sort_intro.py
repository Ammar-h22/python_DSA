"""
There are 3 basic sorting algorithms:
1) Bubble Sort
2) Selection Sort
3) Insertion Sort

Other two advanced sorting algorithms are:
1) Merge Sort
2) Quick Sort

Space complexity:
Bubble Sort = O(1)
Selection Sort = O(1)
Insertion Sort = O(1)
Merge Sort = O(n)
Quick Sort  = O(n)

Worst case time complexity:
Bubble Sort = O(n2)
Selection Sort = O(n2)
Insertion Sort = O(n2)
Merge Sort = O(n log n)
Quick Sort  = O(n2)

Best case time complexity:
Bubble Sort = O(n)
Selection Sort = O(n2)
Insertion Sort = O(n)
Merge Sort = O(n log n)
Quick Sort  = O(n log n)

Average case time complexity:
Bubble Sort = O(n2)
Selection Sort = O(n2)
Insertion Sort = O(n2)
Merge Sort = O(n log n)
Quick Sort  = O(n log n)
