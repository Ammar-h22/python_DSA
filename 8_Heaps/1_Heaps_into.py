"""
Heaps:

Heap itself is a Binary tree. 
(But not a binary search tree, it follows a different pattern of representation)

There are two types of heap: "Max Heap" and "Min Heap".
Max heap: Highest value at the top
Min heap: Lowest value at the top

Heap can contain duplicates, whereas BST cannot contain duplicates.

Heap is a complete tree. (Means all the elements are filled from left with no gaps)

Heaps are not good for searching.

Also a priority queue is best implemented using a heap because both operations i.e 
insert and remove are O(log n).
